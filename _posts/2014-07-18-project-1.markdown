description: Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a method use to measure the environmental impacts of a product, process or a service over its life cycle. A LCA considers the entire life cycle from raw material extraction to end-of-life disposal, quantifing energy consumptions, carbon emissions, water use and waste providing comprehensive insights to inform the organisation on potential improvements in achieving sustainability. How can we help? We perform comprehensive LCA studies, all of which can be tailored to suit your specific needs and objectives to steer your business towards sustainable practices and products.
